# Time-Refraction
Exploring Models for Time-Dependent Refractive Index Materials and Confirming the Temporal Snellâ€™s Law of Time-Refraction with Finite-Difference Time-Domain Simulations

For now the report can be found in <a href="github.com/RyanAPhys/Time-Refraction/4th_Year_Project_Report.pdf">./4th_Year_Project_Report.pdf</a>. Once I recieve the all clear this will be made public and will be available at RyanAPhys.github.io/Time-Refraction.
