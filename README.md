# Time-Refraction
Exploring Models for Time-Dependent Refractive Index Materials and Confirming the Temporal Snellâ€™s Law of Time-Refraction with Finite-Difference Time-Domain Simulations

For now the report can be found in ./4th_Year_Project_Report.pdf. Once I recieve the all clear this will be made public and will be available at RyanAPhys.github.io/Time-Refraction.
